<center>The Indefinite Sleepovers !</center>

<h1 align=center>All the times you never came to my house,
<br>The times we missed the chance to have fun outings in Lucknow,
<br>and all the amazing indelible memories we could've made;
<br>We compensated for all of them by spending every waking moment together.
<br>My weekends used to start by you coming over in my room and waking me up
<br>And they used to be spent lying in your room all day.
<br>And ab ki toh kya hi baat karni. 
<br>We're kinda inseparable, aren't we?
<br>Love you, Snubbs.
<br>Always have, always will.
<br>To a million more years together.</h1>

<br>You can give me a treat if you want.
<br>No pressure.
<br><br>Lots of Love,
