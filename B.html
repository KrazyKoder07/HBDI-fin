<br>I still remember the day we were sitting in Western Music Class on those classic benches just humming along to Aloka aunty's fun tunes, you knocked me on my shoulder.
<br>I turned around to find this person with light freckles on her cheek and a fountain on her head asking me,
<br>"Do you know Pranjal?"
<br>The prankster that I was, I replied yes. When you asked if he was my brother, I replied yes to that too.
<br>And that's how we spoke to each other for the first time.
I wonder how long it took for you to realise that Pranjal was in fact NOT my brother.
<br>Because let's face it, Ishita. Why would my brother be studying in a different city, duh? :P</p>
